**Features of the Stopwatch**

**1.Start/Pause Functionality:**

The stopwatch can be started and paused using the "Start" and "Pause" button. When the stopwatch is running, the button text changes to "Pause" to indicate that clicking it will pause the stopwatch. When paused, the button text changes to "Start" to indicate that clicking it will resume the stopwatch.

**2.Reset Functionality:**

The "Reset" button stops the stopwatch and resets the timer display to "00:00:00". It also clears any recorded lap times.

**3.Lap Functionality:**

The "Lap" button records the current time on the stopwatch when pressed. Each recorded lap time is displayed below the stopwatch. Laps are numbered sequentially starting from 1.

**4.Time Display:**

The stopwatch displays time in the format of hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds (hh:mm:ss
), which updates in real-time.
